# 3. Division Rules of Plant Cells

Plant cells may have different division frequency and different division angles, depending on their identity (eg., epidermality), geometric information (eg., position, cell area, ...), or inheritable properties (the mother cells' identity). Here tens of division frequency control and division angles control will be introduced. 

## 3.1 Division Frequency Control
The cell division frequency control in PlantVertexModel is based on cell time (except "Random Pick" control). Cell time is defined as the length of cell cycle (eg., the default value assigned is 500). The longer cell time means lower cell division frequency. The relative cell time is the inverse of relative cell division frequency. After each 10,000 simulation steps, cell time of every is increased by 1.
