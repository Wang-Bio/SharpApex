# 1. Introduction to Vertex Model and PlantVertexModel
## 1.1 Introduction
Vertex model is a computational model to simulate proliferating organ morphogenesis, based on cell expansion and cell division. The PlantVertexModel is a implementation of this model by C++, originated from vertex model for animal epidermis development in Inoue Lab (Kyoto Univ.), modified and developed for plant organ morphogenesis by Tsukaya Lab (Univ. Tokyo) and Mochizuki Lab (Kyoto Univ.).
