# 5. Creating Your Own Analysis or Rules

To create your own geometric analysis or cell division rules, please carefully read the [User's Guide](../User's%20Guide) and follow the [Tutorials](../Tutorials). Also, you may need certain level of coding and understanding of the maths that your analysis or rules may require. In this Guide section, I would like to share you with the experience of how to create a new geometric analysis - the negative curvature, and how to create a new division rule - the biregion biased angles control.

## 5.1 A example of how to write codes on analyzing "Negative Curvature"

### 5.1.1 Problem Statement and Math Model 

### 5.1.2 Design a Coding Workflow and Define the Input and Output of Functions

### 5.1.3 Start Coding !

### 5.1.4 Check Coding Constantly

## 5.2 A example of how to wrtie codes on rules of "Biregion Biased Angles Control"

### 5.2.1 Problem Statement and Math Model 

### 5.2.2 Design a Coding Workflow and Define the Input and Output of Functions

### 5.2.3 Start Coding !

### 5.2.4 Check Coding Constantly
